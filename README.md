# pythontutorials

Welcome to my Python tutorial! This is the Python module that I taught in the UT Practical Introduction to Research Methods course during my time as a TA. This tutorial is a modified version of the REU/TAURUS Python tutorial led by Jackie Champagne (https://github.com/jbchampagne/pythontutorials).
